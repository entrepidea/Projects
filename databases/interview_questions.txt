Morgan Stanley Interview 05/17/17

	How to diagnose a slow SQL? Explain plan
	Plain SQL and Stored Proc, which is better? Why?
	
	What's primary key? What's unique key? Can we have nullable primary key?
	primary key is a unique key but it can't be nullable. Both PK and UK is a column or a combine of columns that uniqiely identify a row. They are conceptually the same.
	
	What's difference b/w union and union all?
	
	What's left outer join? 
	
	Table A 
	x, y
	1,2
	2,3
	Table B
	a, b
	1,1
	2,3
	A left join B on A.x = B.a and A.y = B.b
	what's the output?

	Have  you done anything like data modeling from database side?
	

10/15/14, Markit on site	

	20. primary key v.s. Unique key
	21. cluster index v,s regular index
	
	22. 
	There is a table with two columns:
	name, value
	A          1
	A          2
	A          3
	B          1
	B          2
	B          3 
	Write a query to list all groups with their 2nd largest value, so the output should be:
	A          2
	B          2
	
	(I used  a query on  a sub query to get the result, he agreed it worked, but say I did two iterations of the table, that's low efficient and since this is Oracle, he suggested looking into 
	Analytic query).
	
	
	23. I have a million records to be inserted to the database, what's the best approach to achieve it?
