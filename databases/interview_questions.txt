	Question S1: given two tables
	StudentName    {studentId, nonEmpty_fullName} and
	StudentAddress{studentId, nonEmpty_address}
	
	print all students with missing name or missing address. StudentId is

Morgan Stanley Interview 05/17/17

	How to diagnose a slow SQL? Explain plan
	Plain SQL and Stored Proc, which is better? Why?
	
	What's primary key? What's unique key? Can we have nullable primary key?
	primary key is a unique key but it can't be nullable. Both PK and UK is a column or a combine of columns that uniqiely identify a row. They are conceptually the same.
	
	What's difference b/w union and union all?
	
	What's left outer join? 
	
	Table A 
	x, y
	1,2
	2,3
	Table B
	a, b
	1,1
	2,3
	A left join B on A.x = B.a and A.y = B.b
	what's the output?


Blackrock, phone interview with Kenny Ma, 08/18/14	

	Have  you done anything like data modeling from database side?
	

10/15/14, Markit on site	

	20. primary key v.s. Unique key
	21. cluster index v,s regular index
	
	22. 
	There is a table with two columns:
	name, value
	A          1
	A          2
	A          3
	B          1
	B          2
	B          3 
	Write a query to list all groups with their 2nd largest value, so the output should be:
	A          2
	B          2
	
	(I used  a query on  a sub query to get the result, he agreed it worked, but say I did two iterations of the table, that's low efficient and since this is Oracle, he suggested looking into 
	Analytic query).
	
	
	23. I have a million records to be inserted to the database, what's the best approach to achieve it?

Credit Suise onsite interview (01/29/14)
========================================
DB and PL/SQL (decent)
in PL/SQL, what's bind? whats that for?
It's similar to the dynamic in-place value setting, like to substitute the ? in the preparedStatement.
Whats the benefit of using bind?
performance, as the store pro is pre-compiled.
What is more?
Security? prevent hacking such as SQL injection.
SQL injection example?



Design data models. This is corporate loan project, suppose we have the borrowing company, and loan info. The company, for the sake of simplicity, has info name and country; the loan, has amount and date. A company can have multiple loans. Design data models for company and loan.

I first designed the company to have Id, name and country; but he pointed out the id along can't unique identify the entity, so i said composite_id that includes multiple columns. He said that would work but it's better to have the Loan table to have the company_id as FK, not the other way around.
How about adding a new intermidiate table to include ID columns from both table?

Write SQL to return the company name and sum of the loans belong to respective companies;

Write SQL to list all companies that have more than one loans.



Asked about normalization. They are OK if you don't know how to do it.

What's dirty read? How to avoid it? Give details about optimistic lock and pessimistic lock, how are they implemented in Oracle?

Difference b/w Function and procedure?
