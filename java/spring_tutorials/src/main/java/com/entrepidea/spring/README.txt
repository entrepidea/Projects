this is a testing project of Spring framework.

the examples code in this project is mainly from the official Spring doc.
http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/

The packages are so named that they suggest the chapters in the doc. 
For example, com.entrepidea.spring.ioc is Chapter 5: "The IOC container"

The code could be from other sources. If that's the case, I am trying to make it clear in the code's comment, other than that it's by default from Spring framework doc.
