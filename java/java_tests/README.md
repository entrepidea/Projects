This project, java_tests include code snippets pertinent to java programming. I tried my best to categorize them to be most reasonable (frequent update is ongoing though, including this README)

For small but completed applications, I put them under "main" folder; while other code snippets that only test an idea or a knowledge point, I treat them as unit tests and put them into "test" folder.

Java is envolving, as of 2017, JDK 9 is rolling out. Even though new features are exciting they still fall into the aforementioned categories as improvements, therefore they would be found in the respective sub packages. For those don't, such as Lambda (since JDK 8), they have their own sub packages.
