/**
 * Question C2: implement printHolidaysInGivenYear(int fourDigitYear),
 given static reference data like
 New year is 1st day in Jan
 Memorial is last Monday in May
 Thanksgiving is 4th Thu in Nov
 ....

 For example, printHolidaysInGivenYear(2017) should print
 "New Year is 20170101"
 "Memorial is 20170529"
 "Thanksgiving is 20171123"
 ....

 You design the data structure to hold the static reference data.
