# algos
classical algorithms and data structures.<br/> 
In this section I tried to classify the algo problems into categories.
#progress
This part is to trace the progress of execises.<br/> 

We start with the leetcode easy part: https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/?difficulty=Easy<br/>

The code can be written in either Java or Python, we don't deliberately crate a Leetcode folder 
for this set of execises, rather we use certain naming conventions: If you see a class name like LE101XXXX, which means Leetcode, Easy, #101. <br/>

By extension, LM=Leetcode Medium; LH=Leetcode Hard.
