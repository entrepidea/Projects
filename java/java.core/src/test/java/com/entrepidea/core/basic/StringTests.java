    //TODO Is String immutable? what's the benefit of immutable class? Why is String immutable?
    /*String is immutable. Being immutable, a class is secure, thread-safe and somehow performant since its value can be cached.
    That a String being immutable is pretty much a design decision. Most important, security. Since String is used as parameters
    in occasions such as url connection, db connection and reflection to restore a class object.
