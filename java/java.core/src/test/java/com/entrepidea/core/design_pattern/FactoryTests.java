    //I wouldn't characterize that they are different. Factory is an alternative to using regular "new" operator to construct a Java object, it normally hides away the details in constructor. Builder is more like a evolving version of Factory - constructing a object using Factory pattern and customize or update the object more at late stage, when it's needed. Related patterns include Abstract Factory and Prototype.
