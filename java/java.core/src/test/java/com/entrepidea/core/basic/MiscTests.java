    /*
        onsite BofA interview, continuance of the phone interview on 10/01/14
    * TODO 1) code on Eclipse

        There is a folder containing stock files, each line of which includes info as below, and delimiter is "\t".
        date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"
        indicator (BUY/SELL), this is counter party BUY from or SELL to BofA
        symbol
        counter party
        quantity
        price

        There are 100 such files and each file contains 10,000 lines.

        In the same folder there is also a short file, marks.txt in which there are two columns in each line showing the symbol and market price, for example:
        AAPL 350.00

        Task: reading the file and figure out the long positions that BofA hold on the stocks, list top 20 in the descendant order with regard to value (quantity*price) and the respective market value. For instance, BofA might buy/sell AAPL, if the net is long, you have to figure it out and count it as required above.


        TODO 2) white board

                Create a high efficient cache solution for computation, it must be thread safe.

                public interface Computable <K, V> {
                  public V compute(K k);
                }

                public class Cache <K,V> implements Computable<K,V>{
                    //the Caculator below is a delegate to do the heavy lift, but the result can be cached so it's supposed to call only once
                    private Computable<K,V> caculator = new Caculator<K,V>();
                    private Map<K,V> cache = new HashMap<K,V>();

                    public V compute(K k){
                            if(cache.contains(k){
                              return cache.get(k);
                            }
                            V val = caculator.compute(k);
                             cache.put(k,val);
                             return val;
                    };
                }

        What's the problem with the above implementation? How to make it highly performant and thread safe?
        I wrote a good implementation with synchronization and he complimented "nearly perfect" but he continue to request to create a "lock-free" solution, I couldn't do it and he wrote one using FutureTask, I don't remember the details. And he also suggested a even better one using AKKA's actor.
        I didn't say but IMHO the common idea that synchronization is a performance penalty is just a urban legend - with the nowaday's modern Java compiler the overhead of synchronization is just trivial.

        TODO    4) Eclipse a Lock implementation, use only AtomicBoolean
