/**
 * @Desc:
 * The details of the question can be found in here:
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stock-buy-sell/
 * However there seemed to have two variations of this problem:
 * 1. Buy or sell only once each day
 * 2. Buy 1 sell any times each day
 * For the 2nd variation, my friend Victor Tan gave a solution in here:
 * https://github.com/tiger40490/repo1/blob/py1/py/algo_arr/maxProfit_buy1sellAny.py
 *
 * @date: 03/13/20
 *
 * @Note:
 * This question was asked on a 01/27/20 Goldman onsite interview and again in a Bank of New York HankRank test on 02/18/20.
