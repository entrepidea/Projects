About java/java_tests
=====================
Managed by maven.

Most simple snippets are coded as unit tests thus in the test folder (with a hierachy).

Those under main folder are completed, runnable java applications, even though not necessarily big;  Applications under jide and swing package are those with a GUI.

Detailed explainations and referencing links are embedded in java code, to help understand the knowledge point the code tries to convey. 

There might be other README under sub-folders, other than that, no seperated documentation is required.
