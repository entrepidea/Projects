this is the sample code from the book "fluent python"

To avoid over-categorization, no more directories are to be created underneath chapters.

file names would be descriptive suffixed with chapter and section numbers

as always, pay attention to the comments in the files if there is any

other knowledge points that don't come with code will be put into a "notes.txt" file under respective chapters.
